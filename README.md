# MANZ Website

This site is built using Gatsby, allowing us to easily add features like offline support and dynamic React pages for forms etc.

## Contributing

Make sure you have the NodeJS installed, then install the Gatsby CLI:

    npm install -g gatsby

You can then run the website locally:

    gatsby develop

Changes will be reloaded in realtime.

Please look at our [issues list](https://github.com/MutualAidNZ/website/issues) for inspiration on what to work on next. We will be accepting PRs. The website is then automatically built and deployed to our Netlify instance.
